## Performance Patterns

### Cost vs. Correctness
- **Correct answers:** $0.064 average cost
- **Wrong answers:** $0.078 average cost
- **Observation:** Wrong answers cost MORE (∆ $0.013) - suggests inefficient exploration

### Time vs. Correctness
- **Correct answers:** 311s average (5.2 min)
- **Wrong answers:** 291s average (4.8 min)
- **Observation:** Correct answers take slightly LONGER (+21s) - more thorough research

### Efficiency Metric
Formula: `accuracy / (time × cost)`

- **Correct examples:** 0.0749 efficiency
- **Wrong examples:** 0.0000 efficiency
- **Mean:** 0.0112

**Analysis:** Current metric heavily penalizes incorrect answers (0 efficiency). This may be too harsh for optimization.

### Outliers
- **Example 11:** Highest cost ($0.180, 2.4× average)
  - 20 web searches (2.4× average)
  - 332k tokens
  - 5.6 min execution
  - **Result:** WRONG (0% accuracy)
  - **Conclusion:** Inefficient - more searching ≠ better results

---

## Token Usage Deep Dive

### Distribution
- **Mean:** 158k tokens/example
- **Range:** 46k - 332k
- **Standard deviation:** High variance in complexity

### Cached Tokens
- **Example 0:** 28,800 cached (12% of prompt)
- **Savings:** ~90% discount applied = $0.003 saved
- **Total impact:** Modest (cache hit rate varies by example)

### Prompt vs. Completion
- **Prompt (input):** ~88% of tokens
- **Completion (output):** ~12% of tokens
- **Cost split:** 45% LM from input, 55% from output (due to 8× output price)

---

## Web Search Analysis

### Usage Pattern

## Cost Efficiency Analysis

### Current Economics (CORRECTED)
- **Cost per correct answer:** $0.74 ($2.21 / 3 correct) [was $0.50, corrected]
- **Cost per attempt:** $0.110/example [was $0.076, corrected]
- **Waste rate:** 85% (17 wrong × $0.110 = $1.87 wasted)

### Projected at Scale
- **1000 examples at 15% accuracy:**
  - Cost: $75.60
  - Correct: 150
  - Cost per correct: $0.50

### Target Efficiency (30% accuracy)
- **1000 examples at 30% accuracy:**
  - Cost: $75.60 (same)
  - Correct: 300 (2× current)
  - Cost per correct: $0.25 (50% reduction)

## Efficiency Metric Evaluation

### Current Formula
```python
efficiency = accuracy / (time_seconds × cost_usd)
```

**Problems identified:**
1. **Too harsh:** Wrong answers = 0 efficiency (no gradient)
2. **Units unclear:** Result has strange dimensions
3. **No normalization:** Hard to interpret absolute values

### Proposed Improvements

**Option 1: Normalized Efficiency**
```python
efficiency = (accuracy × 100) / (time_minutes × cost_dollars)
# Result: "accuracy points per minute-dollar"
# Example: 15% in 5min at $0.08 = 37.5 points/$-min
```

**Option 2: Accuracy-Weighted Cost**
```python
efficiency = accuracy / cost_dollars
# Result: "accuracy per dollar"
# Simpler, easier to interpret
# Ignores time (but time correlates with cost)
```

**Option 3: Composite Score**
```python
# Normalize each component to 0-1 scale
norm_acc = accuracy  # already 0-1
norm_time = 1 - (time / max_time)  # invert: faster = better
norm_cost = 1 - (cost / max_cost)  # invert: cheaper = better

efficiency = 0.5 × norm_acc + 0.3 × norm_time + 0.2 × norm_cost
# Weighted composite with accuracy priority
```

**Recommendation:** Start with Option 2 (accuracy/cost) for GEPA, evaluate Option 3 for production.
