# Agent Code Refactoring Plans

## Overview
This document tracks the refactoring plans for agent.py to improve readability and maintainability.

## Active Plans

### 1. Extract Subagent Execution Logic ✅
**Goal**: Create dedicated helper function to handle subagent execution
**Status**: Active
**Benefits**: 
- Reduces complexity in main flow
- Centralizes error handling
- Makes testing easier

### 2. ~~Extract Tool Configuration~~ ❌
**Status**: SKIPPED (per user request - would worsen readability)

### 3. Simplify Parallel Execution ✅
**Goal**: Create helper for parallel task execution
**Status**: Active
**Benefits**:
- Cleaner async/await handling
- Centralized result processing
- Better error handling

### 4. Extract Logging/Debug Output ✅
**Goal**: Create consistent logging helpers
**Status**: Active
**Benefits**:
- Consistent output format
- Easier to control verbosity
- Cleaner main logic

### 5. Simplify Memory Operations ✅
**Goal**: Create wrappers for memory operations
**Status**: Active
**Benefits**:
- Hide JSON conversion complexity
- Consistent memory key format
- Easier memory debugging

### 6. Extract Model Configuration ✅
**Goal**: Centralize LM initialization
**Status**: Active
**Benefits**:
- Single place for model config
- Easier to swap models
- Cleaner initialization

### 7. Improve Main Flow in aforward() ✅
**Goal**: Simplify main orchestration logic
**Status**: Active
**Benefits**:
- Clear separation of phases
- Easier to understand flow
- Better maintainability

### 8. ~~Extract Response Preparation~~ ❌
**Status**: SKIPPED (per user request - would worsen readability)

### 9. Simplify Final Report Generation ✅
**Goal**: Extract final report logic from run()
**Status**: Active
**Benefits**:
- Cleaner run() method
- Reusable report generation
- Better separation of concerns

### 10. Consider Using Dataclasses for State ⏸️
**Goal**: Use dataclass for agent state
**Status**: Consider Later
**Benefits**:
- Cleaner state management
- Type safety
- Immutability options

## Plan Adjustments Log

### 2024-01-20
- Removed Plan #2 (Extract Tool Configuration) - would add unnecessary abstraction
- Removed Plan #8 (Extract Response Preparation) - response dict is simple enough inline
- Prioritizing plans that significantly reduce complexity without adding layers

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Main methods (aforward, run) under 50 lines each
- [ ] Helper functions under 20 lines each
- [ ] Clear separation between orchestration and execution
- [ ] Improved error handling and logging
- [ ] Maintained or improved performance
