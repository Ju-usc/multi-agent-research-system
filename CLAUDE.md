### Key Files Overview

- **agent.py**: Refactored orchestration system - implements LeadAgent with clean separation of concerns through helper methods for planning, execution, and synthesis
- **config.py**: Centralized configuration for environment variables, model constants, and logging setup
- **models.py**: All Pydantic models (SubagentTask, SubagentResult, Memory) and DSPy signatures in one place
- **tools.py**: Class-based tool implementations (WebSearchTool, MemoryTool) with async support
- **utils.py**: Helper functions including prediction_to_json and Langfuse observability setup
- **eval.py**: Evaluation with accuracy/efficiency metrics, GEPA optimization, and DSPy's built-in result saving
- **dataset.py**: Handles BrowseComp dataset operations including downloading, XOR decryption with canary checking, and conversion to DSPy Examples

## Design Principles

### 1. Strategic Orchestration
- **Lead Agent as Coordinator**: Focuses exclusively on strategy, planning, and synthesis - never conducts primary research
- **Smart Query Classification**: Categorizes queries as depth-first (multiple perspectives), breadth-first (independent sub-questions), or straightforward
- **Detailed Task Decomposition**: Each subagent receives specific objectives, output formats, tool guidance, and clear boundaries

### 2. Efficiency Through Parallelization
- **Multi-level Concurrency**: Lead spawns 3-5 subagents in parallel; each subagent uses 3+ tools simultaneously
- **Token Budget Management**: Subagents have explicit "research budgets" (5-15 tool calls) to prevent inefficient exploration
- **Diminishing Returns Detection**: Agents recognize when further research yields minimal new information

### 3. Advanced Prompt Engineering
- **Extended Thinking Mode**: Visible thinking processes serve as controllable scratchpads for planning
- **OODA Loop Implementation**: Subagents follow Observe-Orient-Decide-Act cycles for systematic research
- **Scaling Heuristics**: 1 agent for simple queries, 2-4 for comparisons, 10+ for complex multi-part tasks

### 4. Production Reliability
- **Stateful Error Handling**: Resume from checkpoints rather than restarting expensive operations
- **Context Window Management**: Agents summarize and store essential information before hitting context limits
- **Memory Persistence**: Lead agents save plans to survive context truncation at 200k tokens

### 5. Quality Control
- **End-State Over Process**: Evaluate whether agents achieved correct outcomes, not prescribed paths
- **Multi-Criteria Evaluation**: Assess factual accuracy, citation quality, completeness, and tool efficiency
- **Source Quality Heuristics**: Prioritize primary sources, avoid SEO farms, distinguish speculation from facts

## Refactored Architecture

### Modular Design
The codebase has been refactored from a monolithic 611-line agent.py into focused modules:

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Configuration separated into `config.py`
   - Data models extracted to `models.py`
   - Tool implementations moved to `tools.py`
   - Helper utilities in `utils.py`
   - Agent logic focused purely on orchestration

2. **Clean Code Improvements**
   - Helper methods for complex operations (execute_subagent_task, execute_tasks_parallel)
   - Consistent logging using Python's standard logging module
   - Memory operations wrapped for cleaner JSON handling
   - Main methods (aforward, run) reduced to under 50 lines each

3. **Testing Structure**
   - `test_agent.py`: Integration tests for end-to-end functionality
   - `test_agent_units.py`: Comprehensive unit tests with proper mocking
   - 19 unit tests covering all refactored methods
   - Tests for error handling, parallel execution, and memory persistence

### Key Refactored Methods

1. **execute_subagent_task()**: Handles individual subagent execution with error handling
2. **execute_tasks_parallel()**: Manages concurrent subagent execution and result collection
3. **store_to_memory()**: Simplified memory storage with automatic JSON conversion
4. **plan_research()**: Extracted planning logic with trace updates
5. **synthesize_results()**: Isolated synthesis phase with decision making
6. **generate_final_report()**: Separated final report generation using ReAct
7. **init_language_models()**: Centralized LM initialization

## Implementation Guidelines

### When Reviewing Code
1. **Verify Orchestration Pattern**: Lead agent should only plan and synthesize, never research directly
2. **Check Parallelization**: Ensure both agent-level and tool-level concurrent execution
3. **Validate Token Budgets**: Each subagent must have explicit limits on tool usage
4. **Assess Task Decomposition**: Subagent instructions should be highly specific and bounded

### Key Performance Targets
- **Token Multiplier**: Expect ~15x more tokens than single-agent chat
- **Quality Improvement**: Target 90%+ better performance on research tasks
- **Context Efficiency**: Each subagent acts as intelligent filter with own context window

### Source Documentation
- `source_docs/leadagent_prompt.md`: Reference implementation for lead agent behavior
- `source_docs/subagent_prompt.md`: Pattern for subagent task execution
- `source_docs/article.md`: Technical deep-dive on multi-agent system architecture

### General Guidelines

- Always try to explain in the planning phase what you are going to do as the user wants to learn technical details.
- Do not overcomplicate the planning phase try to simplify approaches only to contain the most important and necessary components.

## Important General MCP Guidelines
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files unless explicitly requested
- Use MCP tools proactively when they can enhance accuracy or provide better context
### mcp__Context7__resolve-library-id, get-library-docs
**When to use:**
- When needing up-to-date documentation for libraries/frameworks
- For researching API references and implementation patterns
- When implementing features using third-party libraries
- To understand best practices and usage examples for specific packages
**Best practices:**
- ALWAYS call `resolve-library-id` first to get the Context7-compatible library ID
- Use the returned library ID with `get-library-docs` to fetch documentation
- Specify a topic parameter to focus on specific aspects (e.g., 'hooks', 'routing')
- Adjust tokens parameter based on needed context (default: 10000)
- For ambiguous library names, select based on name similarity, description relevance, and trust score
**Important notes:**
- Only bypass `resolve-library-id` if user explicitly provides a library ID in format '/org/project' or '/org/project/version'
- Consider documentation coverage and trust scores when selecting from multiple matches
- Request clarification for highly ambiguous queries before proceeding
### mcp__deepwiki__read_wiki_structure, read_wiki_contents, ask_question
**When to use:**
- When working with GitHub repositories requiring documentation understanding
- Before implementing features to understand existing patterns/conventions
- To discover API references, installation guides, or architectural decisions
- When user asks about specific library/framework usage in a repo
**Best practices:**
- Always start with `read_wiki_structure` to understand available topics
- Use `read_wiki_contents` for detailed documentation on specific sections
- Use `ask_question` for targeted queries about the repository
- Combine these tools for comprehensive understanding before coding
**Important limitations:**
- Some repositories (e.g., stanfordnlp/dspy) have documentation exceeding the 25,000 token limit for `read_wiki_contents`
- When encountering token limit errors, use `ask_question` for specific queries instead
- For large documentation sets, prefer targeted questions over attempting to read entire contents

# Important Clean Code Rules

## Naming
- Use descriptive variable names
- Functions should do one thing
- Avoid abbreviations

## Functions
- Keep functions small (< 20 lines)
- Use early returns
- Avoid nested conditionals

## Comments
- Code should be self-documenting
- Comments explain why, not what
- Keep comments up to date

## Project Execution

**This project uses `uv` instead of `pip`/`python`**:
- Run files: `uv run python <file.py>`
- Run tests: `uv run pytest`
- Run specific test file: `uv run pytest tests/test_agent_units.py -v`
- Run evaluation: `uv run python eval.py --num-examples 5`
- Run with GEPA optimization: `uv run python eval.py --optimize --optimize-steps 10`
- Install deps: `uv sync`

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage:

### Unit Tests (`tests/test_agent_units.py`)
- Tests for all refactored helper methods with proper mocking
- Coverage for error handling, parallel execution, and memory operations
- 19 tests covering execute_subagent_task, execute_tasks_parallel, store_to_memory, plan_research, synthesize_results
- Integration tests for full agent flow including multiple cycles and error recovery

### Integration Tests (`tests/test_agent.py`)
- End-to-end agent functionality tests
- BrowseComp evaluation framework tests
- Real agent execution with actual LLM calls

## General Workflow

1. **Review plans.md** → Finalize/adjust plans
2. **Create/update tasks.md** → Based on finalized plans.md
3. **Implement** → Refer to tasks.md for specific steps
4. **Update tracking** → Mark completed tasks in tasks.md
5. **Update CLAUDE.md** → Update the CLAUDE.md file with the new information

## Git Worktree Workflow

### Setup
```bash
# Create worktree structure
mkdir ~/project-worktrees && cd ~/project-worktrees
git clone <repo> main && cd main
git worktree add ../feature-x -b feature/x
git worktree add ../experiment --detach  # For quick experiments
```

### Key Commands
- **Add worktree**: `git worktree add ../name -b branch-name`
- **List worktrees**: `git worktree list`
- **Remove worktree**: `git worktree remove ../name`
- **Switch branches**: `cd ../experiment && git checkout <branch>` (test without affecting main)

### Productivity Pattern
```
project-worktrees/
├── main/          # Primary development
├── plans.md       # High-level strategy (shared)
├── feature-x/
│   └── tasks.md   # Feature-specific tasks
├── feature-y/
│   └── tasks.md   # Feature-specific tasks
└── experiment/    # Temporary experiments (detached HEAD)
```

### Best Practices
- Run Claude instances in parallel: one per worktree
- Each worktree maintains independent state (no stashing needed)
- Experiment freely without creating branches: `git worktree add -d ../experiment`
- Clean up worktrees after merging: `git worktree remove ../feature-x`
