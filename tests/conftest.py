"""
Pytest configuration - automatically loaded for all test files.

Mocks external observability/telemetry tools to prevent:
- API calls during tests (costly, pollutes production data)
- Network requests (slower tests, requires credentials)
- Import errors when dependencies not configured

NOTE: This is the standard pytest pattern for mocking external dependencies.
Langfuse mocking is centralized HERE (not in individual test files) following
pytest best practices. This conftest.py is automatically loaded before any test
execution, ensuring all test files benefit from these mocks without duplication.
